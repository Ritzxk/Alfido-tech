# Project Requirements:
- Programming Language: Python is the most commonly used language for this type of project due to its extensive machine learning libraries and tools.

- Libraries:

scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and tools.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib or seaborn: For data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook or a code editor: For writing and running your code.
Dataset: The Iris dataset, which is commonly included in machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.

- Machine Learning Model: Choose a classification algorithm that suits your project. Start with simple models like decision trees or k-nearest neighbors, and later explore more complex algorithms as needed.

- Evaluation Metrics: Select appropriate evaluation metrics for classification, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

- Documentation: Keep clear and organized documentation for your code and project findings.

# Project Steps:

Install the necessary libraries, including scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.
Set up a Python environment (e.g., Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook).
- Data Loading and Exploration:

Load the Iris dataset using scikit-learn or seaborn.
Explore the dataset: check for missing values, examine data statistics, visualize data distribution, and plot some graphs to understand the data.
- Data Preprocessing:

If needed, perform data preprocessing, which may include handling missing values, data normalization or scaling, and encoding target labels.
- Data Splitting:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
- Model Selection:

Choose a machine learning algorithm for classification. Common choices include decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN).
- Model Training:

Fit the selected model to the training data.
- Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Visualize the results using confusion matrices, ROC curves, or other relevant plots.
- Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional):
Optimize the model's hyperparameters through techniques like grid search or random search to improve performance.
- Model Deployment :
  Deploy the model by making web app using streamlit.
